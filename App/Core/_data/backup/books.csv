It is a world populated by both angels and demons, and it is essential that we understand it. In Angels and Demons Ron Phillips brings you a definitive guide to these supernatural beings, providing a basic training manual in the war between good and evil. We are not powerless against the forces of darkness, but to survive we must know both our allies and our real enemies.

Or can the spirits be seen with human eyes, through the lens of Church Ethics? The gift of discerning of spirits is indispensible to the study of church ethics. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), wrote two sets of Rules for Discerning of Spirits in his Spiritual Exercises in the early 1500s. He taught how the church can receive from God the gift to see otherwise invisible angels, demons, and the Holy Spirit. Ignatius' views were influenced by John Cassian, Jacobus de Voragine, Ludolph of Saxony, and Thomas a Kempis. Ignatius' Rules are exegeted in dialogue with contemporary scholars Karl Rahner, Hugo Rahner, Piet Penning de Vries, Jules Toner, and Timothy Gallagher, and applied to one study of ecclesial ethics in the narrative theology of Samuel Wells. A four-step Ignatian ""pneumato-ethical method"" is developed, which any analyst can follow to see the spirits, by consolation/desolation, consent, manifestation, and pneumato-ethics. This method revolutionizes how we study ecclesiology, soteriology, missiology/world religions, liturgy, worship, Eucharist, hermeneutics, homiletics, pastoral counseling, church history, and politics. The spirits are not invisible at all. They can be clearly discerned through the lens of ecclesial ethics.";{Religion};290;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tE9JAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The book gives readers the “back story” on particular plot points, Dante references, symbols, historical events, philosophy, art, music, and architectural works that Brown wrapped into his story. It is also an intellectually enriching, intriguing, fresh and fun look at Dante, THE DIVINE COMEDY, the world of ideas circulating in Florence on the cusp of the Renaissance, and the relevance of those ideas to our lives and our world today. Dan Burstein and Arne de Keijzer are the world's leading experts on Dan Brown's fiction. Beginning with their path-breaking SECRETS OF THE CODE, which spent six months on the New York Times bestseller list in 2004, and continuing through four other guidebooks to Dan Brown's fiction (as well as three film documentaries and two special editions of US News), Burstein and de Keijzer have sold more than three million copies of Dan Brown-related commentaries in more than thirty languages. In the wake of each Dan Brown title over the last decade, the media (from the History Channel to CNN to MSNBC to USA Today to the Washington Post) have turned to Burstein and de Keijzer for interpretations of Dan Brown's books, decoding of the hidden symbols and ciphers, explanations of the controversies, and thoughtful separation of fact from fiction in these supremely popular stories that somehow always manage to fascinate our culture well beyond the bounds of their pop fiction genre. The ultimate guide for any Dan Brown fan, SECRETS OF INFERNO is entertaining, thought-provoking, and will make the experience of reading INFERNO richer than you ever imagined.

With millions of copies of his books in print, a major motion picture based on The Da Vinci Code in theaters, and religious leaders everywhere launching scathing attacks on his work, Dan Brown is, quite simply, a phenomenon. His novels, intricate mosaics combining well-researched facts with action-packed storytelling, have created their own industry of location tours, seminars—even PBS specials. But perhaps the one thing that still keeps his readers guessing is that nagging question: How much of this is true? The Unauthorized Dan Brown Companion tells all. Unlike the avalanche of books specifically about The Da Vinci Code , The Unauthorized Dan Brown Companion covers all of Dan Brown's books and, crucially, has no religious agenda or political axe to grind—these are the facts. • Could there actually be an unbreakable code that would cripple US intelligence, as in Digital Fortress? • How much truth lies in The Da Vinci Code's history-altering propositions that have so angered the Vatican? • Are the Illuminati from Angels and Demons really alive and well? The answers are here, covering every picture, place, proper name, and historical event through all of Brown's books, explaining what's absolutely true, possible, improbable, or completely fictitious. One of Dan Brown's greatest accomplishments as a writer is his uncanny ability to blur the line between fact and fiction. Now, with The Unauthorized Dan Brown Companion, readers will at last have all of the information to distinguish for themselves between the inventions of a master storyteller and the historical revelations of a first-rate investigator. John Helfers is a full-time writer and editor currently living on Green Bay, Wisconsin. He is the co-editor of The Valdemar Companion, a guide to the work and life of fantasy writer Mercedes Lackey.

Now, with this stunning special illustrated edition of his record-setting Inferno, brought to life by more than 200 breathtaking color images, Dan Brown takes readers deep into the heart of Italy . . . guiding them through a landscape that inspired one of history’s most ominous literary classics. “THE DARKEST PLACES IN HELL ARE RESERVED FOR THOSE WHO MAINTAIN THEIR NEUTRALITY IN TIMES OF MORAL CRISIS.” Harvard professor of symbology Robert Langdon awakens in a hospital in the middle of the night. Disoriented and suffering from a head wound, he recalls nothing of the last thirty-six hours, including how he got there . . . or the origin of the macabre object that his doctors discover hidden in his belongings. Langdon’s world soon erupts into chaos, and he finds himself on the run in Florence with a stoic young woman, Sienna Brooks, whose clever maneuvering saves his life. Langdon quickly realizes that he is in possession of a series of disturbing codes created by a brilliant scientist—a genius whose obsession with the end of the world is matched only by his passion for one of the most influential masterpieces ever written—Dante Alighieri’s dark epic poem The Inferno. Racing through such timeless locations as the Palazzo Vecchio, the Boboli Gardens, and the Duomo, Langdon and Brooks discover a network of hidden passageways and ancient secrets, as well as a terrifying new scientific paradigm that will be used either to vastly improve the quality of life on earth . . . or to devastate it. In his most riveting and thought-provoking novel to date, Dan Brown has raised the bar yet again. Inferno is a sumptuously entertaining read—a novel that will captivate readers with the beauty of classical Italian art, history, and literature . . . while also posing provocative questions about the role of cutting-edge science in our future.

When the NSA's invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant and beautiful mathematician. What she uncovers sends shock waves through the corridors of power. The NSA is being held hostage...not by guns or bombs, but by a code so ingeniously complex that if released it would cripple U.S. intelligence. Caught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Susan Fletcher battles to save the agency she believes in. Betrayed on all sides, she finds herself fighting not only for her country but for her life, and in the end, for the life of the man she loves.

The greatest conspiracy of the past two thousand years is about to unravel. Robert Langdon, professor of religious symbology at Harvard, is in Paris to give a lecture. At the reception that follows, he is scheduled to meet with a revered curator from the world-famous Louvre museum. But the curator never shows up, and later that night Langdon is awakened by authorities and told that the curator has been found dead. He is then taken to the Louvre—the scene of the crime—where he finds out that baffling clues have been left behind. Thus begins a race against time, as Robert Langdon becomes a suspect and, with the help of French cryptologist Sophie Neveu, must decipher a mystifying trail of clues that the two come to realize have been left specifically for them. If Robert and Sophie cannot solve the puzzle in time, an ancient truth could be lost forever—and they themselves might end up as collateral damage.

An ancient secret brotherhood. A devastating new weapon of destruction. When world-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a mysterious symbol—seared into the chest of a murdered physicist—he discovers evidence of the unimaginable: the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati...the most powerful underground organization ever to walk the earth. The Illuminati has now surfaced to carry out the final phase of its legendary vendetta against its most hated enemy—the Catholic Church. Langdon’s worst fears are confirmed on the eve of the Vatican’s holy conclave, when a messenger of the Illuminati announces they have hidden an unstoppable time bomb at the very heart of Vatican City. With the countdown under way, Langdon jets to Rome to join forces with Vittoria Vetra, a beautiful and mysterious Italian scientist, to assist the Vatican in a desperate bid for survival. Embarking on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and even the most secretive vault on earth, Langdon and Vetra follow a 400-year-old trail of ancient symbols that snakes across Rome toward the long-forgotten Illuminati lair...a clandestine location that contains the only hope for Vatican salvation. An explosive international thriller, Angels & Demons careens from enlightening epiphanies to dark truths as the battle between science and religion turns to war.;{Fiction};448;4;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K__fyN2gl9gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

As with other books in the Guide to Imagery series, the goal of this volume is to help contemporary art enthusiasts decode the symbolic meanings in the great masterworks of Western Art. The first chapter traces the development of images of the Creation and the Afterworld from descriptions of them in the Scriptures through their evolution in later literary and philosophical works. The following two chapters examine artists' depictions of the two paths that humans may take, the path of evil or the path of salvation, and the punishments or rewards found on each. A chapter on the Judgment Day and the end of the world explores portrayals of the mysterious worlds between life and death and in the afterlife. Finally, the author looks at images of angelic and demonic beings themselves and how they came to be portrayed with the physical attributes--wings, halos, horns, and cloven hooves--with which we are now so familiar. Thoroughly researched by and expert in the field of iconography, Angels and Demons in Art will delight readers with an interest in art or religious symbolism.;{Art};383;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PEyRIARaKhAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In Angels and Demons, Michael Patella, OSB, offers an accessible and fascinating look at supernatural realities as they really are presented in the Bible and Christian tradition. Among the topics Patella explores with a valuable combination of pastoral wisdom and academic rigor are: the role of angels in the ministry of Jesus the apocalyptic battle in Revelation the occult, possession, and the work of Satan what angels are and what they're not the Last Judgment: how? when? Readers will appreciate Patella's level-headed appraisal of the views of the supernatural world in the various sections of the Bible.

Angels and demons came to form an integral part of the Spanish American cosmology, leading to the emergence of colonial urban and rural landscapes set within a strikingly theological framework. Belief in celestial and demonic spirits soon regulated and affected the daily lives of Spanish, Indigenous and Mestizo peoples, while missionary networks circulated these practices to create a widespread and generally accepted system of belief that flourished in seventeenth-century Baroque culture and spirituality. This study of angels and demons opens a particularly illuminating window onto intellectual and cultural developments in the centuries that followed the European encounter with America. The volume will be of interest to scholars and students of religious studies, anthropology of religion, history of ideas, Latin American colonial history and church history.;{Religion};;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MQsgAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

She is a criminal offender, a woman who has harmed others. Superficially, it seems she is two separate women. ""Victim"" and ""offender"" are binary categories used within law, social science, and public discourse to describe social experiences with a moral dimension. Such terms draw upon cultural narratives of good and bad people and have influenced scholarship, public policy, and activism. The duality of ""good"" and ""bad"" women, separated into mutually exclusive extremes of angels and demons, has helped segregate thinking about, and responses to, each group. In this groundbreaking study, Kathleen J. Ferraro exposes the limits of such thinking by exploring the link between victimization and offending from the perspective of the women charged with the crimes. Interviewing forty-five women charged with criminal offenses (more than half of whom killed their abusers; the others participated in a range of violent crimes related to domestic violence), Ferraro uses their stories to illuminate complex interactions with violent partners, their children, and the legal system. She shows that these women are neither stereotypical angels nor demons, but rather human beings whose complicated lives belie the abstract categorizations of researchers, legal advocates, and the criminal justice system. Ferraro begins with a general discussion of blurred boundaries and the complexity of experience, and moves from there to discuss women's interactions with the criminal processing system. In the course of her study, she reexamines, and finds wanting, many standard ways of evaluating women's violent behavior, including ""mutual combat,"" ""battered woman syndrome,"" and ""cycle of violence."" She argues that a more complex, nuanced understanding of intimate partner violence and how it contributes to women's offending will contribute to public policy less focused on control and accountability of individuals than on developing social conditions that promote everyone's safety and well-being and foster a sense of hope.";"{""Social Science""}";344;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9vPwCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Graves Jr.;Trafford Publishing;2014-04;In Demons, Nephilim, and Angels, Etienne explains how Satan, his demons, fallen angels, aliens, and the giant Nephilim originated and have infiltrated the original earth, the chaotic earth, the restored earth, and the world that we live in. The original earth was a spiritual world that included Lucifer, the angels, cherubs, seraphim, and other created beings and heaven. God created Lucifer and the angels to serve Him. Lucifer was determined to exercise his will to sit on God's throne. He wanted to be God and not a servant of God. Lucifer was a hybrid being, half-man and half-angel. He was the cause of the chaotic earth. In the chaotic earth, God was angry with Lucifer for trying to take His place and tampering with the genes/DNA of the other creatures that lived on the earth and the planets at that time. God destroyed the earth and Rahab, where Lucifer was king, with a flood and turned it upside down and in darkness. Lucifer was kicked out of heaven and demoted to the prince of the power of the air. After God restored the earth and recreated it, He made mankind in His image. Lucifer detests mankind and wants to alter our DNA.;{Religion};98;5;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4-VZAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Scripture speaks about heaven, hell, angels and demons which are a part of this invisible spiritual realm. Internationally renowned Bible teacher R. C.

He ushered in a new era of nationalism in India by articulating the nationalist protest in the language of non-violence, or ahisma, that galvanized the masses into action. Focusing on the principles of satyagraha and non-violence, and their evolution in the context of anti-imperial movements organized by Gandhi, this fascinating book looks at how these precepts underwent changes reflecting the ideological beliefs of the participants. Assessing Gandhi and his ideology, the text centres on the ways in which Gandhi took into account the views of other leading personalities of the era whilst articulating his theory of action. Concentrating on Gandhiâe(tm)s writings in Harijan, the weekly newspaper he founded, this volume provides a unique contextualized study of an iconic manâe(tm)s social and political ideas.;"{""Biography & Autobiography""}";234;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4x34We-mY40C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Deats;New City Press;2005;The story of Mohandas Gandhi, one of the worldÂ’s best-loved and most important promoters of freedom and justice, fascinates every generation. Thrown off a South African train for sitting in a Â“whites onlyÂ” compartment, Gandhi resolved to oppose injustice wherever he encountered it. His life of resistance led him to a remarkable philosophy of nonviolence that culminated in the freedom struggle in India. Part 2 of the book features a selection of quotations from GandhiÂ’s essential writings. Â“Albert Einstein observed, Â‘Generations to come ... will scarce believe that such a one as [Mohandas K.

Among the leading Gandhi scholars in the world, the authors of the timely studies in this volume present numerous ways in which Gandhi's thought and action-oriented approach are significant, relevant, and urgently needed for addressing the major problems and concerns of the twenty-first century. Such problems and concerns include issues of violence and nonviolence, war and peace, religion and religious conflict and dialogue, terrorism, ethics, civil disobedience, injustice, modernism and postmodernism, forms of oppression and exploitation, and environmental destruction. These creative, diverse studies offer a radical critique of the dominant characteristics and priorities of modern Western civilization and the contemporary world. They offer positive alternatives by using Gandhi, in creative and innovative ways, to focus on nonviolence, peace with justice, tolerance and mutual respect, compassion and loving kindness, cooperative relations and the realization of our interconnectedness and unity, meaningful action-oriented engagement of dialogue, resistance, and working for new sustainable ways of being human and creating new societies. This volume is appropriate for the general reader and the Gandhi specialist. It will be of interest for readers in philosophy, religion, political science, history, cultural studies, peace studies, and many other fields. Throughout this book, readers will experience a strong sense of the philosophical and practical urgency and significance of Gandhi's thought and action for the contemporary world.;{Philosophy};282;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LTe_AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It's all the same in the economic world : companies run to win market shares, employees jockey to gain better position, CEO struggle to convince Wall Street that their strategic orientations are the best and so on. But a closer look at the history of the world reveals three excep-tional men who have been involved in immense battles and have been winning amazing victories using Non-Violence Principle. Buddha succeeded in the spiritual era at a worldwide level. He invented an alternative religion, softer than the existing religions of his time, because he considered its too hard for people. Twenty five centuries later, nearly half the people on earth are declaring them-selves Buddhists. Non Violence Principle is inherent to Buddhism from the religion itself to the way people came to it. Gandhi succeeded in the political sphere on a continental scale. He gave battle to English colonialism in the 20th century. He obtained independence of India following Non Violence Principle in the way he politically struggled against his opponents. Rickson Gracie succeed in sports at martial arts level. He demonstrated the superiority of his martial art: Gracie jiu jitsu, versus any other martial arts, with an historic undefeated record of 450 fights between two men. Non Violence Principle is part of his martial art and is the way he followed to defeat all his oppo-nents. The purpose of the book is to draw the lesson from those three exceptional men and to establish Non Violence Principle as key success factor for tomorrow's management.;"{""Business & Economics""}";156;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eCGw3DyRZM8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The book provides an overview of these issues as they are reflected in the region, and covers the period from the conclusion of the Assam Movement till the present. The Assam Movement spawned a culture of violence which led to the emergence of insurgent outfits in the state. This resulted in the naturalization of violence as a part of everyday living. From this vantage point, the book offers a reading of identity as determined by the anxiety surrounding the presence of the migrants. In this book, the issue of migration is seen through the perspective of the society that receives the migrants and defines itself through a negative response to the other.;"{""Social Science""}";308;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tOmICwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Drawing on the legend and lessons of Gandhi, Cortright traces the history of nonviolent social activism through the twentieth century to the civil rights movement, the Vietnam era, and up to the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Gaza. Gandhi and Beyond offers a critical evaluation and refinement of Gandhi's message, laying the foundation for a renewed and deepened dedication to nonviolence as the universal path to social progress. In the second edition of this popular book, a new prologue and concluding chapter situate the message of nonviolence in recent events and document the effectiveness of nonviolent methods of political change. Cortright's poignant ""Letter to a Palestinian Student"" points toward a radical new strategy for achieving justice and peace in the Middle East.

Written by Charles Andrews – a longtime friend of Gandhi’s – Mahatma Gandhi: His Life & Ideas examines from a contemporary activist’s point of view the religious and political environments that influenced the birth of the peaceful resistance movement, the primary tool that Gandhi and the people of his homeland used to gain India its freedom from British rule. Including excerpts from Gandhi’s personal correspondence and professional writings, Mahatma Gandhi: His Life & Ideas provides an ideal introduction to the life and life’s work of one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century. Dr. Arun Gandhi is Mahatma Gandhi’s grandson and cofounder of the M. K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence in Memphis, Tennessee.

But where did they come from? Sean Scalmer uncovers their history in an earlier generation's intense struggles to understand and emulate the activities of Mahatma Gandhi. He shows how Gandhi's non-violent protests were the subject of widespread discussion and debate in the USA and UK for several decades. Though at first misrepresented by Western newspapers, they were patiently described and clarified by a devoted group of cosmopolitan advocates. Small groups of Westerners experimented with Gandhian techniques in virtual anonymity and then, on the cusp of the 1960s, brought these methods to a wider audience. The swelling protests of later years increasingly abandoned the spirit of non-violence, and the central significance of Gandhi and his supporters has therefore been forgotten. This book recovers this tradition, charts its transformation, and ponders its abiding significance.;{History};;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oDcXJxRR4TUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

This biography is an exploration of Shakespeare's life and works, focusing on often neglected literary and historical contexts such as what he read, who he worked with as an author and an actor, and how these various collaborations may have affected his writing. Drawing in particular on the idea of literary personality and on new discoveries about collaboration, the author looks at Shakespeare's role models, both real and fictional. The focus throughout is on Shakespeare's words and on what he learned about writing for his audiences, which the author suggests were more varied than has been thought. Written by a Shakespearean scholar and experienced theatre reviewer, it pays particular attention to Shakespeare's theatrical contemporaries and the ways in which they influenced his writing, offering an account of the life and work of the great poet-dramatist, structured around the idea of memory.;"{""Biography & Autobiography""}";497;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V0Udd61zN4cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Gandhi’s ideas of peaceful protest went on to inspire the marches and sit-ins of the American Civil Rights movement and continue to be the foundations for political and social demonstrations around the world. This biography by leading scholar Douglas Allen presents a new and challenging approach to understanding Gandhi’s life—the time in which he lived, how he shaped history, and how his philosophy and practices can be reformulated in ways that are significant and effective today. Allen analyzes his continuing relevance by addressing key issues of truth and ethics, violence and nonviolence, equality and freedom, as well as ideas of exploitation, oppression, religious conflict, and environmental crises. Allen provides a much needed new perspective on Gandhi that allows us to rethink our basic values and priorities. By helping us understand Gandhi’s life and message, he creates a new paradigm for evaluating truth, nonviolence, peace, and morality; and he offers new criteria for assessing our modern approach to standards of living, development, progress, and meaningful human existence.";"{""Biography & Autobiography""}";191;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-k_VBW6jTTMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The author's original incentive was the desire to ""introduce,"" as they say in England, the new translation of Shakespeare to the public. The tie that binds him so closely to the translator need not deprive him of the privilege of commending the translation.From another side, and still more closely, his conscience was engaged by the subject itself. In contemplating Shakespeare, all the questions relating to art have arisen in the author's mind. To deal with these questions is to set forth the mission of art; to deal with these questions is to set forth the duty of human thought toward man. Such an opportunity for speaking some true words imposes an obligation that is not to be shirked, especially in time like ours. This, the author has understood. He has not hesitated to take every avenue of approach to these complex questions of art and of civilization, varying the horizon as the perspective shifted, and accepting every hint supplied by the urgency of the task. From such an enlarged conception of the subject this book has sprung. This great work does not depend for its value upon the accuracy of its statements of fact, nor even, upon the light it throws upon the life and genius of Shakespeare. It is mainly to be prized as a masterly statement of the author's ideas concerning the proper relation of literature to human life - a statement illuminated by wonderful flashes of poetry and eloquence, and illustrated by strong characterizations of many famous books and men. This is not to say that the present work will not serve, better than most others, as an introduction to Shakespeare, to Aeschylus, and perhaps to some other of the immortals whom it so glowingly celebrates. Victor Hugo (1802-1885) was a French writer who went into exile after Napoleon III seized power (1851), returning to France in 1870. His novels include The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1831) and Les Miserables (1862). Hugo was France's favorite son and, more than that, for years he had been her champion, her conscience and her spirit.";{Drama};452;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mOg3gzkM5IsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In an attempt to analyze the concept of manhood in Macbeth, Howell explores the contradictions and ambiguities that underlie heroic notions of masculinity dramatized throughout the play. From Lady Macbeth's capacity to control and destroy Macbeth's masculine identity, to Macbeth himself, who corrupts his military prowess to become a ruthless and murderous tyrant, Howell demonstrates that heroic notions of masculinity not only reinforce masculine power and authority, paradoxically, these ideals are also the source of man's disempowerment and destruction. Howell argues that in an attempt to attain a higher principle, the means (violence and destruction) and the ends (justice and peace) become fused and indistinguishable, so that those values that inform man's actions for good no longer provide moral clarity.

Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida, All's Well that Ends Well, and Measure for Measure so clearly resist conventional genre classification and reductive critical schemes that they have come to be known as his ""problem plays."" In one of the few books in recent years to take on these notoriously slippery texts as a group, Richard Hillman elegantly turns that artificial categorization to critical advantage, showing us that this radical instability of genre is not an obstacle but an invitation to understanding, and that it frames human existence itself as a tableau of shape-changing uncertainties. In these three works, Hillman explains, the dramatist played with, not according to, the rules of genre; each is an exquisitely volatile fusion of traditional romance material and realistic style, comic resolutions and tragic tendencies. In close, detailed readings of the plays, Hillman shows us how each creates a turbulent world of circulating desire, misplaced blame, moral instability, and pervasive self-deception. With his guidance we see, as Shakespeare's confused characters do not, that even romantic love, for instance, ""is less a subject for serious scrutiny than a red herring,"" and that the real issue is often the wielding of personal and political power. From Hillman's insights arise fascinating new perspectives on such traditional ""problems"" as the culpability of Cressida, Bertram's dubious qualifications as a romantic lead, the dilemma of Isabella, and the moral authority of Vincentio. Informing this exciting analysis at every stage are Hillman's learned discussions of Shakespeare's cultural milieu: the rise of ""citizen comedy,"" the fashion for satire, the stereotype of the malcontent, and the typical Jacobean mixture of cynicism and idealism. The postmodern concept of intertextuality plays a prominent role in the discussion, as does an innovative application of the principle of metadrama. Hillman develops - and combines - these approaches with originality, wit, and intellectual dexterity. In essence, this is a study that reanimates the ""problem plays"" as precisely that, thereby earning the status of a true landmark in Shakespeare criticism.";{Drama};185;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RfoNAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

This edition considers the play in relation to Renaissance conceptions of both dramatic genre and the family, traces the changing critical and theatrical attitudes towards it and places its psychological and dramatic conflicts within the Jacobean cultural and political context.

Through a set of tenaciously detailed readings, the book illuminates a number of persistent problems or conflicts in Shakespearean drama - in particular a contradiction between words and things, body and language, which is also explored in terms of law, sexuality and Nature. Language and desire, Terry Eagleton argues, are seen by Shakespeare as a kind of 'surplus' over and above the body, stable and social roles and a fixed human nature. But the attitude of the plays to such a 'surplus' is profoundly ambivalent; if they admire it as the very source of human creativity, they also fear its anarchic, trangressive force. Underlying such ambiguities, the book convincingly shows, is a deeper ideological struggle, between feudalist traditionalism on the one hand, and the emergence of new forms of bourgeois individualism on the other. This book revels how, in the light of our own contemporary theories of language, sexuality and society, we can understand the issues present in Shakespeare's drama which previously have remained obscure.";"{""Literary Criticism""}";128;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mh50NAN6YdUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Its characters are brilliant conversationalists, including the princesses Rosalind and Celia and their Fool, Touchstone. Soon after Rosalind and Orlando meet and fall in love, the princesses and Touchstone go into exile in the Forest of Arden, where they find new conversational partners. Duke Frederick, younger brother to Duke Senior, has overthrown his brother and forced him to live homeless in the forest with his courtiers, including the cynical Jaques. Orlando, whose older brother Oliver plotted his death, has fled there, too. Recent scholars have also grounded the play in the issues of its time. These include primogeniture, passing property from a father to his oldest son. As You Like It depicts intense conflict between brothers, exposing the human suffering that primogeniture entails. Another perspective concerns crossdressing. Most of Orlando’s courtship of Rosalind takes place while Rosalind is disguised as a man, “Ganymede.” At her urging, Orlando pretends that Ganymede is his beloved Rosalind. But as the epilogue reveals, the sixteenth-century actor playing Rosalind was male, following the practice of the time. In other words, a boy played a girl playing a boy pretending to be a girl. The authoritative edition of As You Like It from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, is now available as an eBook.

Students' Edition by Adams, professor of English in Cornell University. From the Preface: Next to presenting Shakespeare's biography with clarity, I have sought to picture the dramatist against a background of contemporary theatrical life. However much we may think of him as a genius apart, to himself and to his age he appeared primarily as a busy actor associated with the leading stock-company of his time; as a hired playwright-often, indeed, a mere cobbler of old plays-writing that his troupe might successfully compete with rival organizations; and, finally as a theatrical proprietor, owning shares in two of the most flourishing playhouses in London. Thus his whole life was centered in the stage, and his interests were essentially those of his friends and fellow, the actors, who affectionately called him our Shakespeare. To portray the dramatist, therefore, in the atmosphere in which he lived and worked seemed to me the correct procedure.";{};576;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zMfIJwS9n5cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

""As soon as he began to write something,"" comments George Packer in his foreword, ""it was as natural for Orwell to propose, generalize, qualify, argue, judge--in short, to think--as it was for Yeats to versify or Dickens to invent."" Facing Unpleasant Facts charts Orwell's development as a master of the narrative-essay form and unites such classics as ""Shooting an Elephant"" with lesser-known journalism and passages from his wartime diary. Whether detailing the horrors of Orwell's boyhood in an English boarding school or bringing to life the sights, sounds, and smells of the Spanish Civil War, these essays weave together the personal and the political in an unmistakable style that is at once plainspoken and brilliantly complex.";"{""Literary Collections""}";336;5;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uIL-qmlik4QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Andrei Reznikov’s work is the first attempt to fill this gap. Reznikov puts together the pieces of Orwell’s language puzzle, scattered throughout his essays, diaries, letters, radio talks and fiction, and proposes the Newspeak model as Orwell’s way to formulate his theory. The theory is then tested with illustrative examples from three languages—modern English, Nazi German, and Soviet Russian. Finally, the author describes bias-free language as an implementation of Orwell’s ideas.;"{""Language Arts & Disciplines""}";123;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_CEUCFrKhl0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Humanistic Urges Make Inroads Into The Human Psyche Which Show Up His Assertion Of Faith In The Human Endeavour. The Humanistic Urges Which Emanate From His Literary And Fictional Art, Enable Man To Make A Better Living On The Planet Earth Is The Basic Thrust Which The Book Projects Him As A Novelist Of Humanitarian Concern. Orwell S Portrayal Of Life, In All Its Varied Piquant Colours And Perspectives, Helps To Unroll His Perspicacity Of Incessant Love For The Downtrodden, The Plebeian And Above All For The Suffering Humanity. The Book Systematically Studies The Growth And Evolution Of Humanistic Movements Which Enabled Orwell To Envisage That Revolutions Brought About In Terms Of The Socialistic And The Capitalistic Machinations Merely Annihilate Human Aspirations. It Is An Attempt To Emphasize Orwell S Anguish And Disillusionment Which He Faced During The Thirties. It Reveals His Aversion To The Sinister Pacific Designs Of Society. It Is A Depiction Of Orwell S Incessant Search For Man S Retrieval From The Pacifistic Cloister Of Totalitarian And Dictatorial Domains. The Book Lucidly Elevates Orwell As A Committed Writer, Committed To His Love For The Mankind And His Humanitarian Concern For A Meaningful Existence On The Planet Earth.George Orwell Is Ranked Along With The British Writers Like D.H. Lawrence, E.M. Forster And Graham Greene. What Is Striking Is That It Is A Systematic And Analytical Study Of Orwell S Novels, Essays, Letters, Travelogues And His Other Writings From The Humanistic Perspective. The Book Projects George Orwell Not Only As A Political Satirist Or A Polemicist But Also As A Complete Novelist And Connoisseur Of Varied Nuances Of Literature With His Firm Assertion In Man S Dignity And Human Potentialities (Nineteen Eighty Four; Animal Farm). His Other Novels Like Burmese Days, A Clergyman S Daughter, Coming Up For Air Are An Extended Metaphor Of His Deep And Profound Humanitarian Vision. Orwell S Novels Make For Rays Into The Humanistic Urges And Make Assertion Of Faith In The Inherent Potentialities Of Human Life For A Better Living On The Planet.Infact, The Book Intends To Expose Modern Pretence And Hypocrisy And Thus Brings Into Focus Orwell S Relentless Literary And Fictional Efforts Inculcated Against All Forms Of Evil Showing His Aversion To Both The Socialistic And Capitalistic Patterns Of Society. It Deals With The Realistic Exposition Of The Totalitarian And Dictatorial Powers Which Remain Hidden Inside The Whale. As George Orwell Felt The Smoldering Anguish Of The Thirties, His Concern For A Way Out To The Crisis Social, Moral, Political Even Existential Has Been Shared By Other Novelists Like Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, Aldous Huxley, C.P. Snow, Meyers, Rexwarner, John Wain, William Golding And Kingsley Amis.Relevance Of Orwell S Exploration Of The Exquisite Humanistic Urges And His Incessant Humanitarian Concern Is A Transcendental Reality Which Goes On To Remain Undiminished Even With The Turn Of The New Century And The Golden Millennium.";"{""Humanism in literature""}";144;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GlrzZa3GHvMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Written by a dying man in the grimmest of circumstances, the novel was intended as both a warning against totalitarianism and the debasement of language, and as a reaction to Orwell's personal experiences with English socialism and World War II. Clearly, ""1984"" has turned out differently than Orwell depicted. Yet the power of the novel remains undiminished: it continues to scare and enlighten future generations of readers nearly a half century after its original publication. Well-known scholar Robert Plank provides a psychological examination of the roots of Nineteen Eighty-Four, and the curious parallels between the book and its antecedents, including the film Citizen Kane, the novels of Dostoevsky and Kafka, the philosophy of Whorf, Orwell's own life and works, and many other obvious and hidden influences.

Though His Target Was The Soviet Society And The Colonial Powers, But As The Times Have Shown That Even The Democracies Be That India Boasting Of Being The Largest Democracy In The World Or The United States Of America Where Individual Freedoms Are Sought To Be Curtailed In The Garb Of Patriotism Have Come To Follow The Same Totalitarian Attitude. The Distinction Between Democracies And Dictatorships Has Collapsed In Our Times. The Records Are Being Fudged, Past Is Being Distorted And Falsehood Is Being Touted As Truth. These Ideas Of Suppression Of The Freedom Of The Individual Thinking And How Unrelenting Mad Race For Money And Status Is Corrupting And Polluting Society Have Been Effectively Brought Out By George Orwell In His Fictional Works. This Book Deals With His Literary Tools To Enrich The Fiction. It Reveals That How Sometimes Small Things Like Paper Weight In Orwell S Works Help In Understanding Today S World More Than It Was In The Times Of The Author.

Aside from being one of the greatest political essayists in the English language and author of two of the most famous books in twentieth century literature, George Orwell was a man of profound contradictions. George Orwell:English Rebel takes us through the many twists and turns of Orwell's life and thought, from precocious, public school satirist at Eton and imperial policeman in Burma, through his early years as a rather dour documentary writer, and his formative experiences as a volunteer soldier in the Spanish Civil War. Robert Colls traces, in particular, Orwell's complex relationship with his country, from the alienated intellectual of the mid-1930s through a gradual reconciliation, to the exhilarating peaks of his wartime writing. He explores the mistakes and contradictions, the lucky escapes and near misses, and what they tell us about Orwell as man and author.;"{""Biography & Autobiography""}";330;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zXncAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In 1945, he was sent to France and Germany as a war correspondent. This volume collects for the first time all of these articles. Writing from Paris, Cologne and Stuttgart, Orwell reports on the moment of victory in 1945; considers the impact of the occupation on French domestic and foreign policies; and reports with acute insight on the future of a ruined Germany. The articles extend to contemplate the eight years of war in Spain and the new danger presented by Britain's former ally, the Soviet Union. Also, included in this collection are Orwell's book reviews. With typical clarity and precision, he appraises the work of his contemporaries and the key authors of the 1940s, including Julian Huxley, H.G. Wells and T.S. Eliot. He also reviewed F.A. Hayek's The road to serfdom and the new translations of Dostoevsky's Crime and punishment and The brothers Karamazov, as well as the poetry and the work of Joseph Conrad and Sean O'Casey. These reviews and articles are as exhilarating to read today as they were when first written. Orwell's writing shaped the Observer--his essay 'Politics and the English language' was used as the house style and rule book--and continues to influence many journalists. These collected pieces demostrate unequivocally not only why George Orwell is considered to be the greatest political writer of the twentieth century, but why he has also been described as the patron saint of journalism.";{Books};242;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aC4eAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Introduction In this paper, I am going to explore the concept of evolution in H.G Well's ""The Time Machine."" This enormously successful and influential novel, first published in 1895, has been made into two movies in the twentieth century. The novel is generally credited with the concept of time travel using a vehicle which allows the user to explore the fourth dimension by going forward or backwards in time. On another level it is a critical view of the late nineteenth-century Victorian society, and an early masterpiece of dystopian writing. Historically considered, it is one of the first science fiction writings ever published. Wells himself called his work ""scientific Romance"" and the majority of reviewers at the time used the term, too. ""The Time Machine"" was later seen by literary historians as having laid the path for modern science fiction writing. Moreover, the novel utters a sharp criticism of the decadence of the bourgeoisie and provides a critical perspective on the growing gap between upper and lower class in Wells' own time. The main themes and leitmotifs are very ambiguous. The plot illustrates how a typical utopian paradise turns into a dark dystopian vision of a remote future for mankind. In the first part of my paper, the focus lies on the novel's structure as well as on the specific literary devices employed. This includes the narrative frame, interesting aspects of the narration and the protagonist, who is simply, yet amply named ""The Time Traveller"" and an overview of the extraordinary structures of time and place....";{};56;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aiHU91_pgFkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Both were rebelliously critical of the social and political, familial and sexual conventions and structures of their time. They shared broadly similar interests, but their lifestyles differed sharply - as did their views on many subjects, including those discussed in their correspondence: religion, socialism, science, war and world history, the theatre, the profession of authorship, and more. The letters are always forthright, often abusive and quarrelsome, sometimes suggesting that the relationship cannot last. They are also often warm, good-natured, playful, and generous - reflecting a fundamental mutual respect and similarity of outlook, however contrasting the temperament and style. The great majority of the two writers' correspondence is published here for the first time. This volumes comprises the personal correspondence of Shaw and Wells through the course of their friendship of more than forty years, and includes and introductory essay by J. Percy Smith. The letters are fully annotated, and are accompanied by information about the circumstances under which each was written, to enable the reader to follow the course of the frequently tempestuous relationship.;"{""Biography & Autobiography""}";242;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fch6j8VbnHoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

But with all the confidence of his immense genius and wide-ranging appreciation for all things scientific, Wells presents a readable, concise survey of the state of knowledge at his time about the planet and human presence upon it. Wells asks that you read this hefty 1922 work-adapted from his two-volume Outline of History, published in 1920-""straightforwardly almost as a novel is read,"" and indeed, this story of Earth, from its very formation and the first appearance of homo sapiens through the Russian Revolution and the reconstruction after World War I, reads like the most thrilling adventure story ever told. Though it has been factually supplanted by scholarship that came after it, this remains an engaging history, a classic of science fact from one of the fathers of modern science fiction.

Wells's World Reborn;174;William T. Ross;Susquehanna University Press;2002;In 1919, the novelist H. G. Wells published the first edition of The Outline of History, a work destined to be one of the enduring cultural documents of the twentieth century. Aimed at the general reader, the 500,000-word effort was intended by Wells to provide the necessary background so that educated citizens (from any part of the globe) could start to discard their nationalistic and theological blinders and start to see the world as it really was. To Wells's way of thinking, the only way to prevent disasters like World War I, which had just ended, was to drop outmoded prejudices altogether and create a one-world government. The work was an immense success, selling over two million copies in various editions and translations in its first ten years. It was especially popular in the United States, staying in print until the 1970s. In the first extended study of these works, Ross analyzes them as products of a progressive mindset convinced that the Enlightenment tradition of science and reason was the perfect antidote to the current disastrous situation. In addition to asking how far Wells's rhetoric and organization allow his reformist aims to be realized in the Outline, Ross also interrogates all three works on a number of critical topics to see how well Wells's views hold up against contemporary attitudes.;{History};135;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y_wQsHb1eVoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Wells to Iris Murdoch;175;Peter Edgerly Firchow;CUA Press;2008;"Criticism on utopian subjects has generally neglected the literary or fictional dimension of utopia. The reason for such neglect may be that earlier utopian fictions tended to be written by what one would nowadays call social scientists, e.g., Plato or Sir Thomas More. That is also why earlier discussions of utopian fiction were usually written by critics trained in the social sciences rather than by critics trained in literature. To an appreciable degree this still tends to be the case today. Now, however, there is an additional difficulty, for the social scientists are critiquing utopias written by people who are primarily literary, for example, Krishan Kumar on Wells or Bernard Crick on Orwell. Inevitably much of importance--of literary importance--is simply disregarded, and so our understanding of modern utopia is correspondingly diminished. This book aims to put the fiction back into utopian fictions. While tracing the development of fiction in the writing of modern utopias, especially in Britain, it seeks to demonstrate in specific ways how those utopias have become increasingly literary--possibly as a reaction not only against the ""social scientification"" of modern utopias but also in reaction against the modern attempt to institute ""utopia"" in reality, notably in the former Soviet Union but also in consumerist, late-twentieth-century America. After an introductory discussion of how we understand--and how we should understand--modern utopian fictions, the book provides several examples of how those understandings affect our appreciation of utopian fiction. There are chapters on H. G. Wells's Time Machine; Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara; Aldous Huxley's Brave New World; George Orwell's Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four; William Golding's Lord of the Flies; and Iris Murdoch's The Bell. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Peter Edgerly Firchow, internationally recognized scholar and author of numerous works including Reluctant Modernists, W. H. Auden: Contexts for Poetry, Envisioning Africa: Racism and Imperialism in Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness,"" and The End of Utopia, is professor of English at the University of Minnesota. ""Firchow includes much that is praiseworthy in this short book on utopian fiction. . . . Firchow's work displays his very well informed explication and his ability, in most instances, to make literary texts come alive. His treatment of Wells's The Time Machine is simply outstanding. . . . I find his enthusiasm for his texts refreshing and his work on the end of history meticulous. Other scholars of utopian fiction will as well."" -- H-Net Reviews ""Utopian fiction has often been mangled in interpretation on the occasions when it has been read without a sense of irony, for the sake of political analysis, disregarding its artistic nature. To counterpoise such approaches, Firchow offers us a close reading of each of the chosen works, while also placing them in literary context,"" -- Janice Rossen, Partial Answers";"{""Literary Criticism""}";203;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kzT3bY2a0hsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Also included are irreverent portraits of literary luminaries, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ford Maddox Ford, and insightful recollections of Hemingway’s own early experiments with his craft. Widely celebrated and debated by critics and readers everywhere, the restored edition of A Moveable Feast brilliantly evokes the exuberant mood of Paris after World War I and the unbridled creativity and unquenchable enthusiasm that Hemingway himself epitomized.;"{""Biography & Autobiography""}";208;4;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ohpj2Nl9EYQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Phillips;Simon and Schuster;2002-07-25;An assemblage of reflections on the nature of writing and the writer from one the greatest American writers of the twentieth century. Throughout Hemingway’s career as a writer, he maintained that it was bad luck to talk about writing—that it takes off “whatever butterflies have on their wings and the arrangement of hawk’s feathers if you show it or talk about it.” Despite this belief, by the end of his life he had done just what he intended not to do. In his novels and stories, in letters to editors, friends, fellow artists, and critics, in interviews and in commissioned articles on the subject, Hemingway wrote often about writing. And he wrote as well and as incisively about the subject as any writer who ever lived… This book contains Hemingway’s reflections on the nature of the writer and on elements of the writer’s life, including specific and helpful advice to writers on the craft of writing, work habits, and discipline. The Hemingway personality comes through in general wisdom, wit, humor, and insight, and in his insistence on the integrity of the writer and of the profession itself. —From the Preface by Larry W.

Kennedy Library. The Sun Also Rises is a classic example of Hemingway’s spare but powerful writing style. A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces two of Hemingway’s most unforgettable characters: Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. The story follows the flamboyant Brett and the hapless Jake as they journey from the wild nightlife of 1920s Paris to the brutal bullfighting rings of Spain with a motley group of expatriates. It is an age of moral bankruptcy, spiritual dissolution, unrealized love, and vanishing illusions. First published in 1926, The Sun Also Rises is “an absorbing, beautifully and tenderly absurd, heartbreaking narrative…a truly gripping story, told in lean, hard, athletic prose” (The New York Times). This new Hemingway Library Edition celebrates Hemingway’s classic novel with a personal foreword by Patrick Hemingway, the author’s sole surviving son, and a new introduction by Sean Hemingway, grandson of the author. Hemingway considered the extensive rewriting that he did to shape his first novel the most difficult job of his life.

It reflects Hemingway's conviction that bullfighting was more than mere sport and reveals a rich source of inspiration for his art. The unrivaled drama of bullfighting, with its rigorous combination of athleticism and artistry, and its requisite display of grace under pressure, ignited Hemingway's imagination. Here he describes and explains the technical aspects of this dangerous ritual and ""the emotional and spiritual intensity and pure classic beauty that can be produced by a man, an animal, and a piece of scarlet serge draped on a stick."" Seen through his eyes, bullfighting becomes a richly choreographed ballet, with performers who range from awkward amateurs to masters of great elegance and cunning. A fascinating look at the history and grandeur of bullfighting, Death in the Afternoon is also a deeper contemplation of the nature of cowardice and bravery, sport and tragedy, and is enlivened throughout by Hemingway's sharp commentary on life and literature.";"{""Literary Criticism""}";400;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wn69QsdwDlQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

""In Another Country"" tells of an Italian major recovering from war wounds as he mourns the untimely death of his wife. ""The Killers"" is the hard-edged story about two Chicago gunmen and their potential victim. Nick Adams makes an appearance in ""Ten Indians,"" in which he is presumably betrayed by his Indian girlfriend, Prudence.

Yet in Ernest Hemingway: Thought in Action, Mark Cirino observes, “Literary criticism has accused Hemingway of many things but thinking too deeply is not one of them.” Although much has been written about the author’s love of action—hunting, fishing, drinking, bullfighting, boxing, travel, and the moveable feast—Cirino looks at Hemingway’s focus on the modern mind, paralleling the interest in consciousness of such predecessors and contemporaries as Proust, Joyce, Woolf, Faulkner, and Henry James. Hemingway, Cirino demonstrates, probes the ways his character’s minds respond when placed in urgent situations or when damaged by past traumas. In Cirino’s analysis of Hemingway’s work through this lens—including such celebrated classics as A Farewell to Arms, The Old Man and the Sea, and “Big Two-Hearted River” and less-appreciated works including Islands in the Stream and “Because I Think Deeper”—an entirely different Hemingway hero emerges: intelligent, introspective, and ruminative.;"{""Biography & Autobiography""}";176;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CoPirw_dpjwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Benson;Duke University Press;1990-12-28;DIVWith an Overview by Paul Smith and a Checklist to Hemingway Criticism, 1975–1990 New Critical Approaches to the Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway is an all-new sequel to Benson’s highly acclaimed 1975 book, which provided the first comprehensive anthology of criticism of Ernest Hemingway’s masterful short stories. Since that time the availability of Hemingway’s papers, coupled with new critical and theoretical approaches, has enlivened and enlarged the field of American literary studies. This companion volume reflects current scholarship and draws together essays that were either published during the past decade or written for this collection. The contributors interpret a variety of individual stories from a number of different critical points of view—from a Lacanian reading of Hemingway’s “After the Storm” to a semiotic analysis of “A Very Short Story” to an historical-biographical analysis of “Old Man at the Bridge.” In identifying the short story as one of Hemingway’s principal thematic and technical tools, this volume reaffirms a focus on the short story as Hemingway’s best work. An overview essay covers Hemingway criticism published since the last volume, and the bibliographical checklist to Hemingway short fiction criticism, which covers 1975 to mid-1989, has doubled in size.

He concentrated on writing short stories and novels, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1956. But his poetry deserves close attention, if only because it is so revealing. Through verse he expressed anger and disgust—at Dorothy Parker and Edmund Wilson, among others. He parodied the poems and sensibilities of Rudyard Kipling, Joyce Kilmer, Robert Graves, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Gertrude Stein. He recast parts of poems by the likes of Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, giving them his own twist. And he invested these poems with the preoccupations of his novels: sex and desire, battle and aftermath, cats, gin, and bullfights. Nowhere is his delight in drubbing snobs and overrefined writers more apparent. In this revised edition of the Complete Poems, the editor, Nicholas Gerogiannis, offers here an afterword assessing the influence of the collection, first published in 1979, and an updated bibliography. Readers will be particularly interested in the addition of ""Critical Intelligence,"" a poem written soon after Hemingway's divorce from his first wife in 1927.

For Debra A. Moddelmog, the intense debate about the nature of his identity reveals how critics' desires give shape to an author's many guises. In her provocative book, Moddelmog interrogates Hemingway's persona and work to show how our perception of the writer is influenced by society's views on knowledge, power, and sexuality. She believes that recent attempts to reinvent Hemingway as man and as artist have been circumscribed by their authors' investment in heterosexist ideology; she seeks instead to situate Hemingway's sexual identity in the interface between homosexuality and heterosexuality. Moddelmog looks at how sexual orientation, gender, race, nationality, able-bodiedness—and the intersections of these elements—contribute to the formation of desire. Ultimately, she makes a far-reaching and suggestive argument about multiculturalism and the canons of American letters, asserting that those who teach literature must be aware of the politics and ethics of the authorial constructions they promote.";"{""Biography & Autobiography""}";189;5;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ML4uKwK1fEoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

He fished the lakes and creeks near the family’s summer home at Walloon Lake, Michigan, and his first stories and pieces of journalism were often about his favorite sport. Here, collected for the first time in one volume, are all of his great writings about the many kinds of fishing he did—from angling for trout in the rivers of northern Michigan to fishing for marlin in the Gulf Stream. In A Moveable Feast, Hemingway speaks of sitting in a café in Paris and writing about what he knew best—and when it came time to stop, he “did not want to leave the river.” The story was the unforgettable classic “Big Two-Hearted River,” and from its first words we do not want to leave the river either. He also wrote articles for The Toronto Star on fishing in Canada and Europe and, later, articles for Esquire about his growing passion for big-game fishing. Two of his last books, The Old Man and the Sea and Islands in the Stream, celebrate his vast knowledge of the ocean and his affection for its great denizens. Hemingway on Fishing is an encompassing, diverse, and fascinating assemblage. From the early Nick Adams stories and the memorable chapters on fishing the Irati River in The Sun Also Rises to such late novels as Islands in the Stream, this collection traces the evolution of a great writer’s passion, the range of his interests, and the sure use he made of fishing, transforming it into the stuff of great literature.

This landmark volume brings together Hemingway’s most important and timeless writings about the nature of human combat. Passages from his beloved World War I novel, A Farewell to Arms, and For Whom the Bell Tolls, about the Spanish Civil War, offer an unparalleled portrayal of the physical and psychological impact of war and its aftermath. Selections from Across the River and into the Trees vividly evoke an emotionally scarred career soldier in the twilight of life as he reflects on the nature of war. Classic short stories, such as “In Another Country” and “The Butterfly and the Tank,” stand alongside excerpts from Hemingway’s first book of short stories, In Our Time, and his only full-length play, The Fifth Column. With captivating selections from Hemingway’s journalism—from his coverage of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–22 to a legendary early interview with Mussolini to his jolting eyewitness account of the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944—Hemingway on War collects the author’s most penetrating chronicles of perseverance and defeat, courage and fear, and love and loss in the midst of modern warfare.;{Fiction};384;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=seFSAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It is also fascinating to discover early reportorial accounts of events and subjects that figure in his later fiction. As William White points out in his introduction to this work, ""Much of it, over sixty years later, can still be read both as a record of the early twenties and as evidence of how Ernest Hemingway learned the craft of writing.""

Kennedy Library, and with the never-before-published safari journal of Hemingway’s second wife, Pauline Pfeiffer. First published in 1935, Green Hills of Africa is Ernest Hemingway’s lyrical account of his safari in the great game country of East Africa with his wife Pauline. Hemingway’s fascination with big-game hunting is magnificently captured in this evocative narrative of his trip. In examining the poetic grace of the chase, and the ferocity of the kill, Hemingway looks inward, seeking to explain the lure of the hunt and the primal undercurrent that comes alive on the plains of Africa. Green Hills of Africa is also an impassioned portrait of the glory of the African landscape, and of the beauty of a wilderness that was, even then, being threatened by the incursions of man. Hemingway’s rich description of the land and his passion for hunting combine to give Green Hills of Africa the immediacy of a deeply felt individual experience that is the hallmark of the greatest travel writing. This new Hemingway Library Edition offers a fresh perspective on Hemingway’s classic travelogue with a personal foreword by Patrick Hemingway, the author’s sole surviving son, who, himself, spent many years as a professional hunter in East Africa; a new introduction by Seán Hemingway, grandson of the author; and published for the first time in its entirety the African journal of Hemingway’s wife, Pauline Pfeiffer, which provides new insight into the experiences that shaped her husband’s craft.";"{""Biography & Autobiography""}";304;3.5;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RbkrCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The older man's companions beat d'Artagnan unconscious with a pot and a metal tong that breaks his sword. His letter of introduction to Monsieur de Tréville, the commander of the Musketeers, is stolen.

One of these was ""The Vampire,"" a play first performed in 1851. Dumas penned ""The Vampire"" with Auguste Maquet, who had also collaborated with Dumas on many of his most successful romances, including ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" The vampire in Dumas’ s play is named Lord Ruthven after the most famous vampire in literature during the first half of the nineteenth century. In 1819, Dr. John William Polidori wrote the first vampire tale in English literature and named its title character, Lord Ruthven. After the success of the story, Lord Ruthven’ s popularity spread throughout Europe and he became the subject of many plays and stories. Eventually, his notoriety diminished, and Count Dracula, another aristocratic vampire, took his place.

What man, woman, or child of the 1890s could resist these offerings of the Montgomery Ward catalogue, the one book that was read avidly, year after year, by millions of Americans on farms and in small towns across the nation? The Montgomery Ward catalogue provides one of the few irrefutably accurate pictures of what life was ""really like"" in the gay nineties, for it described and illustrated almost anything that anybody could possibly need or want in the way of ""store-bought"" goods. In fact, in that pre-department store era, it was usually the only source for such goods. Imagine if Montgomery Ward had issued an illustrated catalogue in the days of Louis XIV, or Elizabeth I, or Charlemagne: what insights would we have into the daily life of the ""common folk,"" the farmers and shopkeeper, housewives and schoolchildren . . . what sources of information for historians and scholars, collectors and dealers, what models for artists and designers. In 1895, Montgomery Ward was the oldest, largest, and most representative mail-order house in the country. The brainchild of a former traveling salesman, it issued its first catalogue in 1872, a one-page listing of items. By 1895, the catalogue, reprinted here, had grown to 624 pages and listed some 25,000 items, almost all of them illustrated with live drawings. Montgomery Ward was by then a multi-million dollar business that profoundly affected the American economy; and since it reached the most isolated farms and backwoods cabins, its effect on American culture was almost as great. Now once again available, it is our truest, most unbiased record of the spirit of the 1890s. An introduction on the history of the Montgomery Ward Company and its catalogue has been prepared especially for this edition by Boris Emmet, Ph.D. (Johns Hopkins), a foremost expert on retail merchandising. His monumental work Catalogues and Counters has long been recognized as a landmark in the study of American economic history.";"{""Antiques & Collectibles""}";648;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AjqYCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Gallaher;SIU Press;1997;Although General Alexandre Dumas was a fascinating man and a bold, distinguished Napoleonic soldier, he has been overshadowed by the literary successes of his son Alexandre Dumas (The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo) and grandson, the playwright Alexandre Dumas. Gallaher reveals General Dumas' extraordinary life in eighteenth-century France, providing the first biography in English of the mulatto soldier who knew both the favor and the wrath of Napoleon Bonaparte. Born Thomas-Alexandre Davy de Ia Pailleterie in 1762 to an enslaved black woman and a white French nobleman, the young Thomas Alexandre spent his first fourteen years on the island of Saint Domingue. Following his mother's death, Alexandre joined his father in Normandy in 1776. Later, he moved to Paris alone. In 1786, after losing financial support for his libertine Parisian life, Thomas-Alexandre enlisted as a private in the French army under his mother's name?Dumas. From there began a distinguished military career that saw early rapid advancement, peaked with high favor from Napoleon, and ended after unjust attempts on Dumas' life.;{History};183;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zZ-ALXkowCEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Milton's thought has often been too simply described. The approach here is to interrogate more sceptically notions like puritanism, republicanism, radicalism, and dissent. A more complex story emerges, of Milton's culturally rich but ideologically conformist early decades, and of his radicalisation during the later years of Laudianism. We track the internal dynamics of English puritanism in the 1640s and the impact that has on his own convictions. In the 1650s Milton's thought and beliefs were reconciled to the role as public servant. In the 1660s a renewed confidence carried him towards the completion of his greatest project, Paradise Lost, and his final years were ones of creative fulfilment and renewed political engagement. Amid the discontinuities occasioned by shifting political circumstance, by the exigencies of polemical context, and the diversity of genres in which he wrote, Milton emerged as a major political thinker and significant systematic theologian, as well as the most eloquent prose writer and most accomplished poet of the age. A more human Milton appears in these pages, flawed, self-contractory, self-serving, arrogant, passionate, ruthless, ambitious, and cunning, as well as the literary genius who achieved so much.;"{""Literary Criticism""}";512;4.5;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mna5CFphX6gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The first of the two complete texts in this volume, The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates, was easily the most radical justification of the regicide at the time. In the second, A Defence of the People of England, Milton undertook to vindicate the Commonwealth's cause to Europe as a whole.This book, first published in 1991, was the first time that fully annotated versions were published together in one volume, and incorporated a new translation of the Defence.

While the theories of Freud, Lacan, Kohut, and others underlie this pursuit of Milton's ""self,"" Jung and some of his followers provide the basic understanding by which Shawcross places Milton in the panorama of history. His explorations of the psychological underpinnings of Milton's decision to become a poet, of the homoerotic dimensions of his personality, and of his relationships with father and mother demonstrate the extent to which psychobiography proves itself invaluable as a means to appreciate this complex writer and his complex writings. This biography combines the traditional chronological narrative with a technique akin to that of fiction, ""a mixture of times and a triggering of remembrances from various time frames without time differentiations."" Such an approach offers a view of Milton ""not only in being but in process of being.""

The carefully selected sources range from landmark essays in the history of criticism to journalism and contemporary opinion, and little published documentary material such as letters and diaries. Significant pieces of criticism from later periods are also included, in order to demonstrate the fluctuations in an author's reputation. Each volume contains an introduction to the writer's published works, a selected bibliography, and an index of works, authors and subjects.

This volume surveys the wide range of Defoe's fiction and non-fiction, and assesses his importance as writer and thinker. Leading scholars discuss key issues in Defoe's novels, and show how the man who was once pilloried for his writings emerges now as a key figure in the literature and culture of the early eighteenth century.;"{""Literary Criticism""}";;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TurTWZ8990kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Moreover, the boundaries of genre within his wide-ranging oeuvre can prove highly fluid. In this study, Robert James Merrett approaches Defoe's body of work using interdisciplinary methods that recognize dialectic in his verbal creativity and cognitive awareness. Examining more than ninety of Defoe's works, Merrett contends that this author's literariness exploits a conscious dialogue that fosters the reciprocity of traditional and progressive authorial procedures. Along the way, he discusses Defoe's lexical and semantic sensibility, his rhetorical and aesthetic theories, his contrarian theology, and more. Merrett proposes that Defoe's contrarian outlook celebrates a view of consciousness that acknowledges the brain's bipartite structure, and in so doing illustrates how cognitive science may be applied to further explorations of narrative art.;"{""Biography & Autobiography""}";409;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c48joQJhpfkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A provocative pamphleteer and journalist, a spy and double agent, a revolutionary and a dreamer, he was variously hunted by mobs with murderous intent and treated as a celebrity by the most powerful leaders of the country. Imprisoned many times, pilloried and reviled by his enemies, through it all he managed to produce some of the most significant literature of the eighteenth century. Daniel Defoe: Master of Fictions is the first biography to view Defoe's complex life through the angle of vision that is most important to us as modern readers--his career as a writer. Maximillian Novak, a leading authority on Defoe, ranges from the writer's earliest collection of brief stories, which he presented to his future wife under the sobriquet Bellmour, to his Compleat English Gentleman, left unpublished at his death. Novak illuminates such works as Robinson Crusoe and Moll Flanders, novels that changed the course of fiction in their time and have remained towering classics to this day. And he reveals a writer who was a superb observer of his times--an age of dramatic historical, political, and social change. Indeed, through his many pamphlets, newspapers, books of travel, and works of fiction, Defoe commented on everything from birth control to the price of coal, and from flying machines to the dangers of the plague. Beautifully and authoritatively written, this is the first serious, full-scale biography of Defoe to appear in a decade. It gives us, for the first time, a full understanding of the thought and personal experience that lie behind some of the great works of English literature.;"{""Biography & Autobiography""}";756;3;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dz6bO8hEDzcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Defoe was known in his time as a prolific journalist and pamphleteer, and his stance and opinion gave rise to criticism and controversy. Contradictory readings of the man behind the masks confused the comprehension of his literary genius. Concealment and dissembling punctuated Defoe's life and work. Following Freud's approach, his essay on Leonardo da Vinci, and Ehrenzweig's Gestalt therapy, Abse undertakes the complex task of uncovering the artist's personality and the source of his creativity. Abse does this by confronting various psychoanalytic hypotheses regarding Defoe in order to understand his work. This book is an original, well-documented, and compelling cross-disciplinary approach to identity issues and creative genius. It will be of interest to a wide range of readership from students to practitioners or the general public.;{Psychology};308;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DJVeWD6DrzkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

We do not judge Roxana for her conduct, but sympathize with her as a woman because Defoe has made her our friend.

Fortunately, however, for those who wish to get a clear idea of his life and character, the identification is not pure guess-work on internal evidence. He put his own name or initials to some of his productions, and treated the authorship of others as open secrets. Enough is ascertained as his to provide us with the means for a complete understanding of his opinions and his conduct.

Press of Mississippi;2004;"Biography -- History -- Political Science -- Economics --> For over half a century, Canadian-born John Kenneth Galbraith (b. 1908) has been among the most visible of public intellectuals. His articulate and controversial best-selling books-including The Affluent Society, Economics and the Public Purpose, and The New Industrial State-and his very partisan liberal Democrat political and public service activities secured a place for him among the rich and famous of his time. He worked as an adviser to President John F. Kennedy, served as U.S. ambassador to India (1961-1963), and edited Fortune magazine during the mid-1940s. Among American economists of any era, he is rivaled only by Thorstein Veblen for the introduction of phrases that take on a life of their own in the literate idiom. Such Galbraithian phrases as ""the conventional wisdom"" and the ""affluent society"" have become familiar even beyond Galbraith's remarkably wide readership. No other economist of the twentieth century, excepting perhaps John Maynard Keynes, can claim so secure a place in the belles-lettres of the English-speaking world. This collection of interviews documents the long career of an influential economist and political philosopher who has spent much of his professional life in the public eye. Many of the interviews are occasioned by publication of his books and contain their key themes such as the importance of Keynes, the need to include power in economic thinking, and the neglected priorities of aesthetics, poverty, and the environment in affluent America. The interviews also indicate Galbraith's wide-ranging public service and his frequent hobnobbing with the political and intellectual elite. Through the collection, which spans over four decades, Galbraith's erudition, wit, and impassioned liberalism shine through, making this volume an essential companion to his works. James Ronald Stanfield, a professor of economics at Colorado State University, is the author of John Kenneth Galbraith, The Economic Thought of Karl Polanyi: Lives and Livelihood, and Economics, Power, and Culture: Essays in the Development of Radical Institutionalism. Jacqueline Bloom Stanfield, a professor of sociology at the University of Northern Colorado, is the author of Married with Careers: Coping with Role Strain. Her work has appeared in such periodicals as Social Science Journal, American Journal of Economics and Sociology, and Review of Social Economy.";"{""Biography & Autobiography""}";247;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vLBrgzwYFkMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Dunn;Cambridge University Press;2010-11-11;The recent financial crisis has once again seen John Kenneth Galbraith return to the bestseller lists. Yet, despite the continued popular success of his works, Galbraith's contribution to economic theory is rarely recognized by today's economists. This book redresses the balance by providing an introductory and sympathetic discussion of Galbraith's theoretical contributions, introducing the reader to his economics and his broader vision of the economic process. The book highlights and explains key features of Galbraith's economic thought, including his penetrating critique of society, his distinctive methodology, his specific brand of Keynesianism and his original - but largely ignored - contribution to the theory of the firm. It also presents, for the first time, a detailed examination of Galbraith's monetary economics and revisits his analysis of financial euphoria. This unique work seeks to rehabilitate Galbraith's contribution, setting out several directions for possible future research in the Galbraithian tradition.;"{""Business & Economics""}";;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v_dbZYlNVUwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

His trenchant new book distills this lifetime of experience in the public and private sectors; it is a scathing critique of matters as they stand today. Sounding the alarm about the increasing gap between reality and ""conventional wisdom"" -- a phrase he coined -- Galbraith tells, along with much else, how we have reached a point where the private sector has unprecedented control over the public sector. We have given ourselves over to self-serving belief and ""contrived nonsense"" or, more simply, fraud. This has come at the expense of the economy, effective government, and the business world. Particularly noted is the central power of the corporation and the shift in authority from shareholders and board members to management. In an intense exercise of fraud, the pretense of shareholder power is still maintained, even with the immediate participants. In fact, because of the scale and complexity of the modern corporation, decisive power must go to management. From management and its own inevitable self-interest, power extends deeply into government -- the so-called public sector. This is particularly and dangerously the case in such matters as military policy, the environment, and, needless to say, taxation. Nevertheless, there remains the firm reference to the public sector. How can fraud be innocent? In his inimitable style, Galbraith offers the answer. His taut, wry, and severe comment is essential reading for everyone who cares about America's future. This book is especially relevant in an election year, but it deeply concerns the much longer future.";"{""Business & Economics""}";80;4.5;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FraCX-GLxFQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

And this is not just because Galbraith was an imposing figure at 6 feet, 9 inches tall. Throughout his life, Galbraith advised Presidents, made important professional contributions to the discipline of economics, and also tried to explain economic ideas to the general public. This volume pays tribute to Galbraith’s life and career by explaining some of his major contributions to the canon of economic ideas. The papers describe the series of unique contributions that Galbraith made in many different areas. He was a founder of the Post Keynesian view of money, and a proponent of the Post Keynesian view that price controls were necessary to deal with the problem of inflation in a modern economy where large firms already control prices and prices are not determined by the market. He promulgated the view that firms manipulate individual preferences and tastes, through advertising and other means of persuasion, and he drew out the economic implications of this view. He was a student of financial frauds and euphoria, and a forerunner of the Post Keynesian/Minskean view of finance and how financial markets really work. This book was published as a special issue of the Review of Political Economy.;"{""Business & Economics""}";208;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rUuOAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Written by a scholar renowned for energetic political engagement and irrepressible wit, they are models of provocative good sense that warn prophetically of the dangers of deregulated markets, war in Asia, corporate greed, and stock-market bubbles. Galbraith's work has also deeply-and controversially-influenced his own profession, and in Richard Parker's hands his biography becomes a vital reinterpretation of American economics and public policy. Born and raised on a small Canadian farm, Galbraith began teaching at Harvard during the Depression. He was FDR's ""price czar"" during the war and then a senior editor of Fortune before returning to Harvard and to fame as a bestselling writer. Parker shows how, from his early championing of Keynes to his acerbic analysis of America's ""private wealth and public squalor,"" Galbraith regularly challenged prevailing theories and policies. And his account of Galbraith's remarkable friendship with John F. Kennedy, whom he served as a close advisor while ambassador to India, is especially relevant for its analysis of the intense, dynamic debates that economists and politicians can have over how America should manage its wealth and power. This masterful chronicle gives color, depth, and meaning to the record of an extraordinary life.";"{""Biography & Autobiography""}";832;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AgK6BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Galbraith tells how the men were distinguished by the amount of land they’d accumulated, how hard they worked, how hard they drank, but mainly by how frugal they were. It was said that Codfish John McKillop was so economical that when he died and was being lowered into his grave, he lifted the cover of his coffin and handed out his clothes. Educated himself first at the one-room Willey School, where team sports were held to be “bad for a youngster,” and later at Dutton High School under the aegis of an incompetent teacher who believed in learning through terror, Galbraith raced through the early grades and left for the Ontario Agricultural College, en route, eventually, to Harvard.

George Eliot studied German and German literature from the age of twenty. Her first publication, in 1846, was a translation of Friedrich Strauss's Das Leben Jesu; followed, in 1854, by the translation of Ludwig Feuerbach'sDas Wesen des Christentums. That same year George Eliot left England with George Henry Lewes on her first visit to Germany. During the next three months they visited Frankfurt, Weimar and Berlin to collect material for Lewes's biography of Goethe. In this study, Gerlinde Röder-Bolton explores the impact of Goethe on George Eliot, whose elective affinity with Goethe was both ethical and artistic, and analyses George Eliot's responsiveness to Goethe's moral vision and the literary uses she makes of her familiarity with Goethe's work. George Eliot and Goethe: An Elective Affinity concentrates onThe Mill on the Floss and Daniel Deronda, showing how the intertextual relationship withDie Wahlverwandtschaften holds the key to an understanding of the latter part ofThe Mill on the Floss, while the first part of Faust and Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre throw new light onDaniel Deronda. This study, with its close analysis of a range of works by George Eliot and Goethe, is essential reading for anyone interested in both or either of these authors or in Anglo-German literary relations.";"{""Literary Criticism""}";290;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0Y8jujZvutoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Pursuing oddities of diction and figuration, of plotting and characterization, Hertz finds everywhere in Eliot's works passages of high mimetic realism that ask to be read as allegories of writing or as characters whose actions and destinies can only be understood if they are seen as disguised surrogates of their author.

Novels such as Middlemarch and The Mill on the Floss reflect Eliot's complex and sometimes contradictory ideas about society, the artist, the role of women, and the interplay of science and religion. In this book Tim Dolin examines Eliot's life and work and the social and intellectual contexts in which they developed. He also explores the variety of ways in which 'George Eliot' has been recontextualized for modern readers, tourists, cinema-goers, and television viewers. The book includes a chronology of Eliot's life and times, suggestions for further reading, websites, illustrations, and a comprehensive index.

Mintz;Harvard University Press;1978;"Mintz has discovered a new sub-genre of fiction: the novel of vocation. In the nineteenth century, he maintains, work ceased to be merely what one did for a living or out of a sense of duty and became a vehicle for self-definition and self-realization. The change was prepared for by the growth of professions and the increase in middle-class career opportunities, He shows how George Eliot, in particular, linked these new social possibilities to the older Puritan doctrine of calling or vocation, achieving in her late novels a fictional structure that could encompass the conflicting energies of the age. In the idea of vocation she found a way to explore how far it is possible to be ambitious both for oneself and for a large cause, and a way to probe the contradictions between ambitious, self-defining work and the older institutions; of family, community, and religion. The book is solidly grounded in cultural and historical reality. Although Mintz concentrate on George Eliot and especially Middlemarch, he also examines the conceptions of self and work in Victorian biographies and autobiographies and the emergence in late-nineteenth-century fiction of the idea of the vocation of art.";"{""Literary Criticism""}";193;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jxkbMiI0AGsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

This intellectual biography traces the course of that development from her initial Christian culture, through her loss of faith and working out of a humanistic and cautiously progressive world view, to the thought-provoking achievements of her novels. It focuses on her responses to her reading in her essays, reviews and letters as well as in the historical pictures of Romola, the political implications of Felix Holt, the comprehensive view of English society in Middlemarch, and the visionary account of personal inspiration in Daniel Deronda. This portrait of a major Victorian intellectual is an important addition to our understanding of Eliot's mind and works, as well as of her place in nineteenth-century British culture.;"{""Literary Criticism""}";;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ohHkyE8R2CAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Its focus on how writers, including George Eliot, Charles Kingsley and Thomas Hardy, responded to Darwin's discoveries and to his innovations in scientific language continues to open up new approaches to Darwin's thought and to its effects in the culture of his contemporaries. This third edition includes an important new essay that investigates Darwin's concern with consciousness across all forms of organic life. It demonstrates how this fascination persisted throughout his career and affected his methods and discoveries. With an updated bibliography reflecting recent work in the field, this book will retain its place at the heart of Victorian studies.;"{""Literary Criticism""}";;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9cJkAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Excerpt: Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar ) (Marathi: born 24 April 1973) is an Indian cricketer widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket. He is the leading run-scorer and century maker in Test and one-day international cricket. He is the only male player to score a double century in the history of ODI cricket. In 2002, just 12 years into his career, Wisden ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Donald Bradman, and the second greatest one-day-international (ODI) batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards. In September 2007, the Australian leg spinner Shane Warne rated Tendulkar as the greatest player he has played with or against. Tendulkar was an integral part of the 2011 Cricket World Cup winning Indian team at the later part of his career, his first such win in six World Cup appearances for India. Tendulkar is the first and the only player in Test Cricket history to score fifty centuries, and the first to score fifty centuries in all international cricket combined; he now has 99 centuries in international cricket. On 17 October 2008, when he surpassed Brian Lara's record for the most runs scored in Test cricket, he also became the first batsman to score 12,000, 13,000 and 14,000 runs in that form of the game, having also ...";{};260;;en;

With the arrival of global television networks, mass-media coverage and multinational sponsors, cricket has become big business and India has become the economic driving force in the world game. For the first time a developing country has become a major player in the international sports arena. This fully updated and revised edition of Mihir Bose's classic history is a unique account of the Indian cricket phenomenon. Drawing on a combination of extensive research and personal experience, Bose traces the development of the Indian game from its beginnings as a colonial pastime to its coming of age as a national passion and now a global commercial powerhouse. This illuminating study reveals Indian cricket's central place in modern India’s identity, culture and society. Insightful, honest and challenging, Bose tackles the myths and controversies of Indian cricket. He considers the game in terms of race, caste, politics, national consciousness and ambition, money, celebrity and the media, evoking all the unpredictability, frustration and glory that is the magic of Indian cricket.;"{""Social Science""}";304;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6gyAAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

HOW SPORTS MARKETING HAS BOWLED US OVER Sports marketing is all-pervasive today - no matter where you look, there is no escaping a Dhoni, a Tendulkar or a Sehwag. It wasn't always like this. There was a time when sportspersons got fame from sport, but not the money commensurate with that fame. Then Sunil Gavaskar, India's first batsman-entrepreneur, came along, and in his wake followed Kapil Dev and Sachin Tendulkar. Helped by television and competing multinational brands vying to expand their market in a liberalizing India, sports marketing, which in India is synonymous with cricket, exploded. The culmination of this process was the Indian Premier League (IPL), a brilliant marketing concept that was a win-win for players, sponsors, media and viewers alike. This book, written by two sports enthusiasts who are also ace sports marketers with a combined international experience of forty years in marketing, takes us on an engaging and informative journey through the highs and lows of sports marketing in India. Along the way, the authors explain what constitutes good sports marketing, how the market can be expanded, what the prospects are for sports other than cricket, and why the sports fan needs to be better treated. An incisive, heartfelt book that will appeal to sports fans, marketers, advertisers as well as administrators.;"{""Business & Economics""}";;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NQONAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Hill;Lynne Rienner Publishers;2003;In the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, U.S. politicians, policymakers, and citizens focused their desire for retribution not on the obvious target, Japan, but on Hitler's Germany. Richard Hill challenges a major point of conventional wisdom on U.S.-Axis relations to explain why the U.S. held Hitler responsible for the Japanese action - and why Hitler's December 11 declaration of war was inconsequential to the U.S. involvement in the European theatre. Hill's carefully argued analysis reveals widespread acceptance in late 1941 that the route to Tokyo was through Berlin. Despite emerging uncertainty about German guilt for Pearl Harbor, he concludes, the prevailing public opinion in the first weeks after December 7 mandated a Germany-first strategy and continued to color U.S. policy throughout the war.;{History};227;4;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=61WMf6XRVT8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

He also had the opportunity to bowl to stalwarts of Indian cricket like GR Vishwanath, Ashok Mankad, Brijesh Patel and the Amarnath brothers and rub shoulders with the likes of VV Kumar,BishanBedi, Salim Durrani and Hanumant Singh in the vibrant ﬁrst class scene of a largely amateur era. The stories featured in this ﬁne book are recollections of a life spent playing and observing cricket. They are stories of a time when sheer love for the game drove people to cricket grounds. At a time when rampant commercialization has overtaken the game, these stories bring back memories of a simpler time. Nostalgic and insightful, Third Man is a welcome addition to cricketing lore contributed by a former cricketer who, as a journalist today, straddles the worlds of sports and arts.;"{""Sports & Recreation""}";380;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qr16BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

One of the first references to a touring Indian cricket side was in 1889: 'Perhaps the most notable feature of the tour was the wonderfully successful bowing of Mr Pavri, who took 170 wickets at a cost of under 12 runs each'. For a time, India enjoyed a golden age of cricket, largely through Lord Hawke's tours in the 1890s and then buoyed up by the exploits of Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji who was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1897. But there were set-backs to come, such as the team's 1953 'Worst Start in Test Cricket' which saw Trueman scythe through their top order at Headingley to leave the team in disrepair at 0 for 4 wickets after 14 balls. Recent decades have seen formidable players such as Ganguly, Laxman, Sehway, Dravid and Tendulkar lift India's game to great heights, making them a force to be reckoned with. This anthology charts the progress of India through Wisden's pages, using match reports, articles, notes, obituaries and illustrations to bring this extraordinary team - and their equally extraordinary nation - to vivid and delightful life.;"{""Sports & Recreation""}";352;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KdnqVo8a5XMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

That morning, in just over an hour and a half, the planes of the Japanese First Carrier Striking Force sank or severely damaged 18 American warships lying at anchor at the Pearl Harbor naval base on the island of Oahu. This single air raid on a single morning altered the history of the United States and forever changed the way Americans thought about the world. The Attack on Pearl Harbor examines the history leading up to the attack, the specifics of the raid itself, and the consequences of what then-president Franklin Delano Roosevelt called 'a date which will live in infamy'.;"{""Pearl Harbor (Hawaii)"",""Attack on"",1941}";121;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=weNrvRIyeEwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Set in a small rural community the children are learning to cope with highly personal issues of their own when suddenly confronted with the possiblilty of war invading their isolated lives. Larry, the oldest, wants to join the army, but is charged with the care of his lttle sister, Molly, who firmly believes their mother is with the angels. Stella struggles to understand her strange gift of second sight. Ellen's mother seems bitterly unloving for no good reason. Barbara, sent from England to escape the bombs, works hard at settling into her new life. Roland handicapped, silent and brooding seeks ways to reach out to the others. Finding Pearl Harbor is fiction, but the events of World War II are carefully interwoven into the story.

Rosenberg;Duke University Press;2003-08-25;"December 7, 1941--the date of Japan's surprise attack on the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor--is ""a date which will live"" in American history and memory, but the stories that ""will live"" and the meanings assigned to them are hardly settled or singular. In movies, books, and magazines, at memorial sites, in ceremonies, and on television and the internet, Pearl Harbor lives in a thousand guises and symbolizes dozens of historical lessons. A Date Which Will Live examines Pearl Harbor in American history and memory. Historian Emily S. Rosenberg does not try to determine the truth of this iconic event, but rather to explore the variety of cultural meanings--and political contests--that have been attached to the words ""Pearl Harbor."" Rosenberg considers the emergence of Pearl Harbor symbolism from multiple perspectives: as the day of infamy that upended ideas of U.S. military preparedness, the attack that opened a ""back-door"" for U.S. involvement in World War II, a commemorated event, and a rupture in American-Japanese relations. She explores the numerous, overlapping cultural contexts that have contributed to Pearl Harbor's resurgence in American memory since the fiftieth-year anniversary in 1991. Among these she identifies a ""memory boom"" in American culture, the movement to exonerate commanders Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short, and the political mobilization of various groups during the culture and history ""wars"" of the 1990s, as well as the effect of the blockbuster movie Titanic in propelling historical spectacles such as the film Pearl Harbor to theater screens. Rosenberg also discusses the use of Pearl Harbor as a historical frame for understanding the events of September 11, 2001.";{History};236;3;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ppc2TjrMBocC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In this tightly wound, enthralling story reminiscent of Agatha Christie’s works, Lo Blacklock, a journalist who writes for a travel magazine, has just been given the assignment of a lifetime: a week on a luxury cruise with only a handful of cabins. The sky is clear, the waters calm, and the veneered, select guests jovial as the exclusive cruise ship, the Aurora, begins her voyage in the picturesque North Sea. At first, Lo’s stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a dark and terrifying nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for—and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo’s desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong… With surprising twists, spine-tingling turns, and a setting that proves as uncomfortably claustrophobic as it is eerily beautiful, Ruth Ware offers up another taut and intense read in The Woman in Cabin 10—one that will leave even the most sure-footed reader restlessly uneasy long after the last page is turned.;{Fiction};352;3.5;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r-upDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

After all, he’s done this before. Sure enough, Betty soon lets Roy move into her beautiful home, seemingly blind to the web of lies he’s woven around her. But who is Roy, really?

Leonora, known to some as Lee and others as Nora, is a reclusive crime writer, unwilling to leave her “nest” of an apartment unless it is absolutely necessary. When a friend she hasn’t seen or spoken to in years unexpectedly invites Nora (Lee?) to a weekend away in an eerie glass house deep in the English countryside, she reluctantly agrees to make the trip. Forty-eight hours later, she wakes up in a hospital bed injured but alive, with the knowledge that someone is dead. Wondering not “what happened?” but “what have I done?”, Nora (Lee?) tries to piece together the events of the past weekend. Working to uncover secrets, reveal motives, and find answers, Nora (Lee?) must revisit parts of herself that she would much rather leave buried where they belong: in the past. In the tradition of Paula Hawkins's instant New York Times bestseller The Girl On the Train and S. J. Watson’s riveting national sensation Before I Go To Sleep, this gripping literary debut from UK novelist Ruth Ware will leave you on the edge of your seat through the very last page.;{Fiction};320;3.5;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aIOSBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Sneider;Oxford University Press;2008-02-04;"In 1899, Carrie Chapman Catt, who succeeded Susan B. Anthony as head of the National American Women Suffrage Association, argued that it was the ""duty"" of U.S. women to help lift the inhabitants of its new island possessions up from ""barbarism"" to ""civilization,"" a project that would presumably demonstrate the capacity of U.S. women for full citizenship and political rights. Catt, like many suffragists in her day, was well-versed in the language of empire, and infused the cause of suffrage with imperialist zeal in public debate. Unlike their predecessors, who were working for votes for women within the context of slavery and abolition, the next generation of suffragists argued their case against the backdrop of the U.S. expansionism into Indian and Mormon territory at home as well as overseas in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii. In this book, Allison L. Sneider carefully examines these simultaneous political movements--woman suffrage and American imperialism--as inextricably intertwined phenomena, instructively complicating the histories of both.";"{""Social Science""}";224;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PtsFBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Levine;Univ of North Carolina Press;2000-11-09;The differences between Frederick Douglass and Martin Delany have historically been reduced to a simple binary pronouncement: assimilationist versus separatist. Now Robert S. Levine restores the relationship of these two important nineteenth-century African American writers to its original complexity. He explores their debates over issues like abolitionism, emigration, and nationalism, illuminating each man's influence on the other's political vision. He also examines Delany and Douglass's debates in relation to their own writings and to the work of Harriet Beecher Stowe. Though each saw himself as the single best representative of his race, Douglass has been accorded that role by history--while Delany, according to Levine, has suffered a fate typical of the black separatist: marginalization. In restoring Delany to his place in literary and cultural history, Levine makes possible a fuller understanding of the politics of antebellum African American leadership.;"{""Social Science""}";328;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-FUivbKd3sAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It focuses in part on early repertory and how European operatic masterpieces became part of American culture. This book also calls attention to the efforts of American composers as they continually tried to make original contributions to a foreign musical form. Throughout this anthology the contributors use a variety of approaches and styles to analyze the many aspects of opera, and how the form fared in the U.S. In addition to observing where opera has been in this country, this anthology also has an eye to the future. Opera presentation in the coming century may be very different from the current experience. Economics, always a critical factor, may well dictate a different scale of production. Changing tastes in directorial and production values and the expansion of television and video into the home are indicators that a new era has arrived.;{Music};311;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xp2kDn5aBeAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Hidden behind the banner of achieving freedom was the assumption that freedom meant affirming black manhood The struggle for freedom in New England was different for men than for women. Black men in colonial and revolutionary New England were struggling for freedom from slavery and for the right to patriarchal control of their own families. Women had more complicated desires, seeking protection and support in a male headed household while also wanting personal liberty. Eventually women who were former slaves began to fight for dignity and respect for womanhood and access to schooling for black children.;"{""Social Science""}";280;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w_b9ih_U8NAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

LaCocque combines historical, literary, feminist, and liberationist approaches in an engaging synthesis. He argues that the book was written in the post-exilic period and that the author was a woman. Countering the fears and xenophobia of many in Jerusalem, the biblical author employed the notion of h.esed (kindness, loyalty, steadfast love), which transcends any national boundaries. LaCocque focuses on redemption and levirate marriage as the two legal issues that recur throughout the text of Ruth. Ruth comes from the despised people of Moab but becomes a model for Israel. Boaz, converted to the model of steadfast love, becomes both redeemer and levir for Ruth and thus fulfills the Torah. In the conclusion to his study, the author sketches some parallels with Jesus' hermeneutics of the Law as well as postmodern problems and solutions.;{Religion};187;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mxvgEazCDZoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

To this end, he examines the fate and role of the feminine as ""she"" travels from ancient times through various goddesses to the person of Ruth, and her destiny as restoring the original totality of masculine and feminine in equal, interacting, balance. In counterpoint to the scholarly style of her father - while in unison with his interpretations - Nomi Kluger-Nash has written a woman's subjective reactions to the story of Ruth, Naomi and Orpah.";{Psychology};224;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=27muKv9mvuwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Hubbard;Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing;1988;In the Old Testament we read God s word as it was spoken to his people Israel. Today, thousands of years later, we hear in these thirty-nine books his inspired and authoritative message for us. These twin convictions, shared by all of the contributors to The New International Commentary on the Old Testament, define the goal of this ambitious series of commentaries. For those many modern readers who find the Old Testament to be strange and foreign soil, the NICOT series serves as an authoritative guide bridging the cultural gap between today s world and the world of ancient Israel. Each NICOT volume aims to help us hear God s word as clearly as possible. Scholars, pastors, and serious Bible students will welcome the fresh light that this commentary series casts on ancient yet familiar biblical texts. The contributors apply their proven scholarly expertise and wide experience as teachers to illumine our understanding of the Old Testament. As gifted writers, they present the results of the best recent research in an interesting manner. Each commentary opens with an introduction to the biblical book, looking especially at questions concerning its background, authorship, date, purpose, structure, and theology. A select bibliography also points readers to resources for their own study. The author s own translation from the original Hebrew forms the basis of the commentary proper. Verse-by-verse comments nicely balance in-depth discussions of technical matters textual criticism, critical problems, and so on with exposition of the biblical writer s theology and its implications for the life of faith today.;{Religion};331;4.5;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wJQvoHg91QkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The social identity approach is used as a lens through which to understand and derive ethics. This approach highlights the social emphases of a biblical text, and consequently assists in understanding a text s original ethical message. The book of Ruth is used as a test case, employing a social identity approach for understanding the narrative, but also to model the approach so that it can be implemented more widely in study of the Old Testament and narrative ethics. Each of the protagonists in the book of Ruth is examined in regards to their personal and social self-components. This study reveals that the narrative functions to shape or reinforce the identity of an ancient Israelite implied reader. A social identity approach can also highlight the social processes within a society. The social processes taking place in the Monarchic and Persian Periods are discussed, and it is found that the social emphases of the book of Ruth most closely correspond to the social undercurrents of the Persian Period.""";{Religion};234;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RkByCbsWSPoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Scholars agree on the literary virtuosity of its author, but are deeply divided about the way she or he has structured the work. For the first time ever, The Structure of the Book of Ruth makes use of hitherto neglected evidence from ancient Hebrew, Greek, Syriac and Latin manuscripts in an attempt to create a more objective basis for discussions about the book's structure. This type of structural analysis is a powerful new tool in the hands of Bible scholars. Structural irregularities appear to elucidate the redactional history of the Book of Ruth. Structural breaks and links appear to function as markers indicating a certain understanding of the text to the exclusion of other possibilities. The question of divine justice comes out as the central theme of the book. Is it justified to accuse God of injustice, as Naomi did? The time when this problem was most virulent was the exilic and post-exilic period. Naomi appears to stand for the old Zion, the embittered widow of Lamentations 1. Ruth is a personification of the new Zion, the bride whom her divine husband will marry again. The remarkable openness to an active role of foreigners and women in the restoration of Israel is a deliberate protest against the draconic measures of Ezra and Nehemiah against marriages with foreign women.;{Religion};288;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eeCSyiTV_QgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

They tell how after Joshua there was a long period of ups and downs; of religious apostasy within the community and repeated harassment from abroad answered by a series of divinely impelled 'Judges' or 'Deliverers.' They offer some samples of life in Israel, 'in the days when the Judges ruled' or 'when there was not yet a king in Israel.'""

Larkin;A&C Black;1996-01-01;This addition to the Old Testament Guides series studies the only two biblical books to have been named after women, and finds them refreshingly different. A rich field of new writing on Esther is surveyed, showing that this exotic book is emerging from a long period under a cloud to make valuable contributions to a number of current debates: what makes a biblical text theologically valuable or dangerous - and how do our perceptions change? what is the relation beween history and theology? what is the status of variant forms of the biblical tradition? how does the book achieve its literary impact? - and, of course, what contribution does it make to feminist biblical studies? Ruth is more of an established favourite in the biblical canon. The Guide tackles the elusive questions of its dating and the nature of its relationship to Israelite law, as well as the contrivance of its literary beauty and the subtlety of its theology. The needs of students studying Ruth as a set text in Hebrew are taken into account, but the Guide follows the series as a whole in catering primarily for those studying English text.;{Religion};106;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fO9jJWIP1RwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Ambiguity built into grammar, syntax, and vocabulary carrie over into the larger issues of characterization, theology, and the book's purpose. He also argues that Ruth is intended to read as an interlude between Judges and Samuel. Esther, by Timothy Beal, focuses on a story of anti-Judaism in an ancient world that raises contemporary questions about sexism, ethnocentrism, and natioinal identity. Beal questions the text without assuming that there will be univocal answers, allowing for complexity, perplexity, and the importance of accidents. Beal emphasizes the general and the tenative over the continuous.

Dorothy Warren draws on correspondence with family and friends, theatrical reviews, personal interviews, and her own long relationship with Ruth Draper in crafting this biography. Born in New York City in 1884, Ruth Draper began giving monologues at private parties and schools at the age of twenty-six and made her professional debut in 1920 at London's AEolian Hall. In charting the course of Draper's impressive career, Warren follows her performances on stages around the world, including private recitals for Sarah Bernhardt, Eleonora Duse, and the royal families of Britain, Spain, and Belgium. Warren also devotes a significant discussion to Draper's relationship with Lauro de Bosis, the Italian poet and political activist whose 1931 disappearance while dropping anti-Fascist pamphlets over Rome remains unexplained. Draper's long stage reign ended when she died in her sleep following a performance in New York City in December 1956. Ruth Draper's specialty was the monologue, a dramatic composition for a single performer evoking other characters upon the stage. She had in her repertoire sixty dramatic sketches featuring fifty-two characters whom she performed, as well as 316 others whom she evoked during the course of the sketches. Some of her better-known sketches were Opening the Bazaar, Vive la France -- 1940, The Scottish Immigrant, The Actress, and In County Kerry. Draper's unique quality was her ability to project an illusion, to evoke upon the stagethe characters with whom she conversed and interacted. Lynn Fontanne said of this faculty of Draper's: ""There is the flavor of parlor magic in it -- something of conjuring"". Bernard Levin, writing in the Times of London on April 4, 1988, recalls Draper's talent for evocation as ""truly hallucinating"" and adds, ""Before the curtain came down, real hallucination had set in and we could see on the stage a crowd of people who were not there!"" Eleonora Duse declared, ""Ruth Draper is theater"". The World of Ruth Draper features twenty-three illustrations.";"{""Biography & Autobiography""}";137;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7gy0bsbQ0JkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The year is famous, but most fans know very little about the season. During that tumultuous summer, the Great War in Europe cast an ominous shadow over the national game, as enlistments and the draft wreaked havoc with every team's roster. Players and owners fought bitterly over contracts and revenue, the parks were infested with gamblers, and the Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs almost called off the World Series. And a Boston player known as The Colossus -- 23-year-old Babe Ruth -- began his historic transformation from pitching ace to the game's greatest slugger. Wood also poses a chilling question: Was the 1918 World Series fixed? Sports Illustrated called the book ""an entertaining and exhaustive account of a tumultuous season"" and Robert W. Creamer, author of the definitive biography of Ruth, said ""Mr. Wood has lit upon one of the most turbulent and important and at the same time least known years in baseball history. He has done remarkable, revelatory research, and he has a clean, clear way of writing.""";"{""Sports & Recreation""}";420;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Um5v66RiRCwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

How does God act in our lives? How are we to act as God's faithful people? Joshua, Judges, and Ruth represent a chorus of voices reflecting on Israel's earliest days in its land. In Joshua, God empowers an obedient Israel to conquer the promised land. In Judges, Israel's faithlessness and God's wrath lead to a downward spiral of sin, subjugation, and social disintegration. Ruth narrates a story of divine blessing worked out through human loyalty. Within these plots, the characters wrestle with a range of issues including faithfulness versus faithlessness, identity, leadership, and the nature of providence. Pressler explores these themes in their historical context while also presenting their relevance for the church today. --From publisher's description.;{Religion};312;;en;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7W4-RjlzWy4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
